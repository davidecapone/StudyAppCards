# SDMProject

## Overview
This repository contains a mobile application project (written in Java) designed to enhance students' study experiences by providing tools to manage and review study materials effectively. 
The app helps students prepare for exams and quizzes by allowing them to create, organize, and practice questions in various formats.

One of the core features of this app is the concept of "Question Sets" (also referred to as "cards"). Question Sets allow students to group related questions together, making it easier to focus on specific subjects or topics. Each Question Set can contain multiple questions, which can be either multiple-choice or open-ended. This structured approach helps students systematically cover all the necessary material and track their progress over time.
